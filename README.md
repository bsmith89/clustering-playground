# Setup

- Have `conda` installed and working.
- Clone this repo `https://github.com/bsmith89/clustering-playground`
- Build the conda environment: `conda env create -n clust-tutorial -f conda.yaml`  (`mamba` is faster and should also work, if you have it installed.)
- Activate the conda environment: `conda activate clust-tutorial`
- Start jupyter notebook `jupyter notebook`
- Go to the jupyter notebook URL, e.g. `localhost:...`.
